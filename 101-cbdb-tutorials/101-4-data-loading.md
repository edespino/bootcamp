# Lesson 4: Data Loading

This tutorial briefly introduces 3 methods to load the example data `FAA` into Cloudberry Database tables you have created in the previous tutorial [Lesson 3: Create Tables](../101-cbdb-tutorials/101-3-create-tables.md). Before continuing, make sure you have completed the previous tutorial.

- Method 1: Use the `INSERT` statement. This is the easiest way to load data. You can execute `INSERT` directly in psql, run scripts that have `INSERT` statements, or run a client-side application with database connection. It is not recommended to use `INSERT` to load a large amount of data, because the loading efficiency is low.

- Method 2: Use the SQL statement `COPY` to load data into database. The `COPY` syntax allows you to define the format of the text file so that data can be parsed into rows and columns. This method is faster than the `INSERT` statement. But, like `INSERT` statement, `COPY` is not a parallel data loading process.

    The `COPY` statement requires that external files be accessible to the host where the master process is running. On a multi-node Cloudberry Database system, data files might reside on a file system that is not accessible from master node. In this case, you need to use the psql command `\copy meta-command` that streams data to Cloudberry master node over `psql` connection. Some example scripts in this tutorial use the `\copy meta-command`.

- Method 3: Use Cloudberry Database utilities to load external data into tables. When you are working with a large-scale data warehouse, you might often face the challenge of loading large amounts of data in a short time. The utilities, `gpfdist` and `gpload`, are tailored for this purpose, enabling you to achieve rapid, parallel data transfers.

    During your data loading process, if any rows run into issues, they will be noted. You can set an error threshold that fits your needs. If the number of problematic rows exceeds this limit, Cloudberry Database will stop the loading process.

    For optimal speed, combine the use of external tables with the parallel file server (`gpfdist`). This approach will help you maximize efficiency, making your data loading tasks smoother and more efficient.

    _Figure 1. External Tables Using Parallel File Server (gpfdist)_

    Another utility `gpload` is a batch job. When using this utility, you should specify a YAML-formatted control file, describe source data locations, format, transformations required, participating hosts, database destinations and other particulars in the file. `gpload` will parse the control file and use `gpfdsit` to execute the task. This allows you to describe a complex task and execute it in a controlled and repeatable way.

## Quick-start operations

In the following exercise, you will load sample data into the `tutorial` database using each of these above methods.

### Load data using `INSERT`

In [Lesson 3: Create Tables](../101-cbdb-tutorials/101-3-create-tables.md), you have created 6 tables in the `tutorial` database, one of which is `d_cancellation_codes` in the `faa` directory.

The `faa.d_cancellation_codes` table is a simple 2-column look-up table. You will load data into the table using the `INSERT` statement.

<!-- You change to directory faa, containing FAA data and scripts, take a look at table faa.d_cancellation_codes, insert data into table.  -->

1. Log into Cloudberry Database in Docker as `gpadmin`, and change to the `faa` directory. This directory contains `faa` data and scripts.

    ```shell
    [gpadmin@mdw ~]$ cd /tmp/faa
    ```

2. Log into the `tutorial` database as `lily`.

    ```shell
    [gpadmin@mdw faa]$ psql -U lily -d tutorial
    ```

    ```shell
    Password for user lily:  # changeme

    psql (14.4, server 14.4)
    Type "help" for help.

    tutorial=>
    ```

3. Check the `faa.d_cancellation_codes` table.

    ```sql
    tutorial=> \d d_cancellation_codes
    ```

    Output:

    ```sql
              Table "faa.d_cancellation_codes"
       Column    | Type | Collation | Nullable | Default
    -------------+------+-----------+----------+---------
     cancel_code | text |           |          |
     cancel_desc | text |           |          |
    Distributed by: (cancel_code)
    ```

4. Insert data into the `faa.d_cancellation_codes` table.

    ```sql
    tutorial=> INSERT INTO faa.d_cancellation_codes
    tutorial-> VALUES ('A', 'Carrier'),
    tutorial-> ('B', 'Weather'),
    tutorial-> ('C', 'NAS'),
    tutorial-> ('D', 'Security'),
    tutorial-> ('', 'none');
    ```

    Output:

    ```sql
    INSERT 0 5
    tutorial=>
    ```

### Load data using `COPY`

The `COPY` statement moves data from the file system to database tables. Data for 5 of the `faa` tables is in the following CSV-formatted text files:

1. In a text editor, open and check the following `.csv` data files. 

    - `L_AIRLINE_ID.csv`
    - `L_AIRPORTS.csv`
    - `L_DISTANCE_GROUP_250.csv`
    - `L_ONTIME_DELAY_GROUPS.csv`
    - `L_WORLD_AREA_CODES.csv`

    Note that the first line of each file contains the column names, and that the last line of each file contains the characters `.`, which signals the end of the input data.

2. In a text editor, open and check the following SQL scripts:

    - `copy_into_airlines.sql`
    - `copy_into_airports.sql`
    - `copy_into_delay_groups.sql`
    - `copy_into_distance_groups.sql`
    - `copy_into_wac.sql`

3. Log into the `tutorial` database as `lily`.

    ```shell
    [gpadmin@mdw faa]$ psql -U lily -d tutorial
    ```

    ```shell
    Password for user lily:  # changeme

    psql (14.4, server 14.4)
    Type "help" for help.

    tutorial=>
    ```

4. Run the following psql `\i` commands to load data into the `faa` tables.

    ```sql
    tutorial=> \i copy_into_airlines.sql
    tutorial=> \i copy_into_airports.sql
    tutorial=> \i copy_into_delay_groups.sql
    tutorial=> \i copy_into_distance_groups.sql
    tutorial=> \i copy_into_wac.sql
    ```

    Output:

    ```sql
    COPY 1514
    COPY 1697
    COPY 15
    COPY 11
    COPY 342
    tutorial=>
    ```

### Load data using the `gpdist` utility

For the `faa` fact table, you will use an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to load data from the source gzip files into a data table. For the best loading speed, use the `gpfdist` utility to distribute rows to segments.

In production system, `gpfdist` runs on file servers that external data resides. However, for a single-node Cloudberry Database instance, there is only one logical host, so you run `gpfdist` on it as well. Starting `gpfdist` is similar as a file server, no data movement will occur until SQL query request has been ended.

> **Note:**
>
> This exercise loads data using `gpfdsit` to move data from external data files into Cloudberry Database. Moving data between the database and external tables also needs security request. Therefore, only superusers are permitted to use `gpfdsit` and you will complete this exercise as `gpadmin` user.

1. Start `gpfdist`:

    ```shell
    [gpadmin@mdw tmp]$ gpfdist -d /tmp/faa -p 8081 > /tmp/gpfdist.log 2>&1 &
    ```

    In this operation:

    - `-d /tmp/faa`: Specifies the directory where the data files reside. The utility will serve the files from `/tmp/faa`.
    - `-p 8081`: Sets the port on which `gpfdist` will listen, in this case, port `8081`.
    - `> /tmp/gpfdist.log`: Redirects standard output to a log file at `/tmp/gpfdist.log`.
    - `2>&1`: Ensures that both standard output and standard error are redirected to the same log file.
    - `&`: Runs the process in the background.

    Once executed, you see `6581`, which indicates the background job number `[1]` and its process ID `6581`.

2. Check the running processes:

    ```shell
    [gpadmin@mdw tmp]$ ps -ef  |grep gpfdist
    ```

    This command checks whether `gpfdist` is running:

    ```shell
    gpadmin   6581  6552  0 16:02 pts/8    00:00:00 gpfdist -d /tmp/faa -p 8081
    gpadmin   6585  6552  0 16:02 pts/8    00:00:00 grep --color=auto gpfdist
    ```

3. View the log file:

    ```shell
    [gpadmin@mdw tmp]$ more /tmp/gpfdist.log
    ```

    This command allows you to view the contents of the `gpfdist.log` file. The log messages indicate the initialization steps of the `gpfdist` utility:

    ```shell
    2023-07-25 16:02:41 6581 INFO Before opening listening sockets - following listening sockets are available:
    2023-07-25 16:02:41 6581 INFO IPV6 socket: [::]:8081
    2023-07-25 16:02:41 6581 INFO IPV4 socket: 0.0.0.0:8081
    2023-07-25 16:02:41 6581 INFO Trying to open listening socket:
    2023-07-25 16:02:41 6581 INFO IPV6 socket: [::]:8081
    2023-07-25 16:02:41 6581 INFO Opening listening socket succeeded
    2023-07-25 16:02:41 6581 INFO Trying to open listening socket:
    2023-07-25 16:02:41 6581 INFO IPV4 socket: 0.0.0.0:8081
    2023-07-25 16:02:41 6581 INFO Opening listening socket succeeded
    Serving HTTP on port 8081, directory /tmp/faa
    ```

The following operations are performed in this section:

1. Set up the necessary tables.

    First, we'll create two tables:

    - `faa_otp_load`: The table where data will be loaded.
    - `faa_load_errors`: A table to log any load errors.

    These operations are purely metadata-based; no actual data will be transferred at this point.

    ```shell
    [gpadmin@mdw tmp]$ cd faa
    [gpadmin@mdw faa]$ psql -U gpadmin tutorial

    tutorial=# \i create_load_tables.sql
    ```

    Note: If you receive an error that the `faa_load_errors` table already exists, you can safely ignore it.

2. Load data from external files.

    The `faa_otp_load` table is structured to match the `faa` Web site's input data format. The external table definition will refer to files in the `faa` directory with a pattern `otp*.gz`. For our example, we have two matching files, one for December 2009 and the other for January 2010.

    Now, let's move the data:

    ```shell
    tutorial=# \i create_ext_table.sql
    tutorial=# INSERT INTO faa.faa_otp_load SELECT * FROM faa.ext_load_otp;
    ```

    Note: Cloudberry Database facilitates moving data from the gzip files into the database's load table. In a production setting, there might be several `gpfdist` processes running, either on separate hosts or multiple on one host, each using a different port.

3. Examine load errors.

    Errors during data loading are common. Let's examine these errors for a better understanding. For clarity, we'll display results in a format where each column data is shown on a new line:

    ```sql
    tutorial=# \x  -- Changes the display of the results to one line per column, which is easier to read for some result sets.
    tutorial=# select DISTINCT relname, errmsg, count(*) from gp_read_error_log('faa.ext_load_otp') GROUP BY 1,2;
    ```

    Once you have reviewed the errors, you can end your session:

    ```sql
    tutorial=# \q
    [gpadmin@mdw faa]$
    ```

    Summary: By now, you should have set up your tables, loaded the data, and had a quick look at any loading errors. This ensures that you have a good understanding of the data quality and structure.


### Load data using the `gpload` utility

Cloudberry Database provides a wrapper program for `gpfdist` called `gpload` that does much of the work to set up external table and data movement. In this exercise, you will reload the `faa_otp_load` table using the gpload utility. 

In this section, we walk through the process of loading data with `gpload`. The steps are:

1. Ensure the environment is clean.

    Before using `gpload`, ensure no `gpfdist` processes from previous tasks are running. Here is how you can check and kill them:

    ```shell
    [gpadmin@mdw faa]$ ps -ef | grep gpfdist
    [gpadmin@mdw faa]$ pkill gpfdist
    [gpadmin@mdw faa]$ ps -ef | grep gpfdist
    ```

2. Customize the `gpload` input file.

    You will need to edit and tailor the `gpload.yaml` input file to your needs. Notably, make sure to set the correct path for the `faa` directory. In this guide, the `gpload.yaml` file has the `TRUNCATE: true` preload instruction. This ensures that any previously loaded data is cleared out before the current loading begins.

    The following is what the `gpload.yaml` file might look like:

    ```shell
    [gpadmin@mdw faa]$ cat ./gpload.yaml

    ---
    VERSION: 1.0.0.1
    # describe the Greenplum database parameters
    DATABASE: tutorial
    USER: gpadmin
    HOST: mdw
    PORT: 5432
    # describe the location of the source files
    # in this example, the database master lives on the same host as the source files
    GPLOAD:
    INPUT:
        - SOURCE:
            LOCAL_HOSTNAME:
            - mdw
            PORT: 8081
            FILE:
            - /tmp/faa/otp*.gz
        - FORMAT: csv
        - QUOTE: '"'
        - ERROR_LIMIT: 50000
        - ERROR_TABLE: faa.faa_load_errors
    OUTPUT:
        - TABLE: faa.faa_otp_load
        - MODE: INSERT
    PRELOAD:
        - TRUNCATE: true
    ```

3. Run the `gpload` command.

    Finally, you can run the gpload command to start the data loading process. If you want a detailed view of the loading, include the -v flag.

    ```shell
    [gpadmin@mdw faa]$ gpload -f gpload.yaml -l gpload.log
    ```

    Summary: At the end of this guide, you would have successfully used gpload to load data into CloudberryDB. Make sure to check the logs for any warnings or errors to ensure data consistency and integrity.


### Create and load fact tables

The final step of the ELT process is to move data from the load table to the fact table. For the `FAA` example, you create 2 fact tables. The `faa.otp_r` table is a row-oriented table, which will be loaded with data from the `faa.faa_otp_load` table. The `faa.otp_c` table has the same structure as the `faa.otp_r` table, but is column-oriented and partitioned. You will load it with data from the `faa.otp_r` table. The 2 tables will contain identical data and allow you to experiment with a column-oriented and partitioned table in addition to a traditional row-oriented table. Then you create the `faa.otp_r` and `faa.otp_c` tables by executing the `create_fact_tables.sql` script. Load the data from the `faa_otp_load` table into the `faa.otp_r` table using the `INSERT FROM` SQL statement. Load the `faa.otp_c` table from the `faa.otp_r` table. Both of these loads can be accomplished by running the `load_into_fact_table.sql` script.

```shell
[gpadmin@mdw faa]$ psql -U gpadmin tutorial

psql (14.4, server 14.4)
Type "help" for help.
```

```sql
tutorial=# \i create_fact_tables.sql
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE

tutorial=#
tutorial=# \i load_into_fact_table.sql
INSERT 0 1024552
INSERT 0 1024552
tutorial=#
```

## Data loading summary

- Key Feature: rapid data loading

    - Extract, load, and t ransform (ELT): This method takes advantage of the massive parallelism of Cloudberry Database.
    - Staging: Data can be staged using methods like external tables.
    - Transformation: Data transformations occur within the Cloudberry Database.
    - Performance: Set-based operations are done in parallel to maximize efficiency.

- Loading mechanisms

    - `COPY`: Loads data via the master in a single process, but doesn't harness CloudberryDB's parallel capabilities.
    - External tables:
        - Advantage: Takes advantage of the parallel processing power of segments.
        - Flexibility: One `SELECT` statement can access multiple data sources.
        - Data availability: Makes static data accessible within the database.
        - Protocols: Defined using `file:// or gpfdist://`.
        - `gpfdist`: A parallel-loading file server program.
        - Static data: External tables can be re-scanned during a query as data remains unchanged.

- External web tables

    - Features:
        - Protocols: Allows the `http://` protocol or an `EXECUTE` clause for OS command/script execution.
        - Dynamic data: Assumes that data might change during query execution. Thus, rescanning is not permitted.
        - Performance: Might be slower if data exceeds memory capacity, leading to I/O operations.
        - Execution: Scripts or processes might run on every segment host.

    - Duplication caution:
        - There is a risk of data duplication, especially when extracting data from another database.
        - Users need to be cautious and verify data when using Web tables.

Understanding and using these features and mechanisms effectively can ensure optimal data loading and management within the Cloudberry Database.
